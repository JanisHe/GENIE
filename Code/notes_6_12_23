
## Main ideas for reducing spatial bias: higher order edges, spatial embedding (at attention layer and maybe inside graph convolutions)
## bias regularization, gradient of loss regularization, adding more nodes to graph, inter-query graph convolution 
## (with skip connection). Training to directly use multiple grids in output. Both a high and low resolution spatial graph.

## Should try absolute node position information also in DataAggregation, and should try adding a station aggregation module
## (which can be Bipartite propagated or "read into" the DataAggregation module).

## Should train the image refinement, and inter-query attention module

## Need to create synthetic data that includes small magnitude moveout events

## Should apply model to detect new events, and compare with local/regional catalogs

## For training data: should sample inputs at multiple depths,
## possibly at multiple kernel values, and can pass in multiple
## nearby picks. Can train a "image refinement" layer, and possibly
## even re-sample misfits from a denser spatial graph during the image
## refinement layer.

## Can turn around directed graph as second edge type
## Subgraph of cartesian product graph can be dense in
## stations but sparse in space, so when convolving
## the spatial information can be diffused.
