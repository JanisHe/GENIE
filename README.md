# GENIE : Graph Earthquake Neural Interpretation Engine

A Graph Neural Network (GNN) based earthquake phase associator, and spatio-temporal source localization model. To be released in the next several months.

For a description of a related GNN architechture, for the source localization component, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05144.
