# GENIE : Graph Earthquake Neural Interpretation Engine

A Graph Neural Network (GNN) based earthquake phase associator, and spatio-temporal source localization model. To be released in the next several months.

For a description of a related GNN architechture applied to source localization from discrete pick datasets, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05144.

Preliminary results of the method are shown here, https://www.scec.org/meetings/2021/am/poster/227.
