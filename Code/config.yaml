degree_padding: 0.25 #This region is appended to the lat_range and lon_range values above, and is used as a `padding' region, where we compute travel times, and simulate events in this region, yet train to predict zero for all labels in this area. This way, sources just outside the domain of interest arn't falsely mis-located inside the region (since the model learns what `exterior' events look like, to some extent).
